## Project Overview
I embarked on a virtual internship with KPMG, where I had the opportunity to apply data analytics skills in a real-world context. The internship journey was divided into three main tasks, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis and visualization.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Data Quality Assessment üßê
In the first leg of my internship, I assessed data quality and completeness using Python and the pandas library. I identified and resolved data issues in a systematic manner, ensuring data completeness, tidiness, validity, accuracy, and consistency. The cleaned data was exported as "KMPG_transform_data.xlsx."

### Task 2: Targeting High-Value Customers üìàüéØ
Task 2 involved the analysis of data to pinpoint high-value customers based on demographics and attributes. I employed exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses, using Python and seaborn. Feature engineering was performed to enhance insights, and the results were exported as "KMPG_visulisation_data.xlsx."

### Task 3: Crafting Interactive Dashboards üìäüì¢
In the final leg of my internship, I used Power BI to create interactive dashboards that brought my findings to life through compelling visuals. I utilized Power Query for data adjustments, data modeling to structure information, and DAX measures to support visualizations, resulting in engaging and informative dashboards.

## Data Exploration

In addition to the tasks mentioned earlier, I've conducted in-depth data exploration, uncovering valuable insights that shed light on various aspects of our business. Here are some key findings:

### Bike-Related Purchases and Profits Across Age Groups and Wealth Segments:
- People aged between 30 to 40 make more bike-related purchases compared to other age groups. They also contribute the most to profit, as shown in both graphs.
- This trend suggests an increase in buying power within this age group, peaking at around 30-40 years, before gradually declining with age, resulting in lower profits.
- Remarkably, the 30-40 age group within the mass customer segment generates the highest profit.

### Leading Job Industries Enhancing Profit and Bike-Related Purchases:
- The majority of profit contributions in the bike-related purchases area come from the top three industry sectors: Financial Services, Health, and Manufacturing, accounting for a total of 57%.
- Interestingly, many of the industries examined generate profits of less than $1,000,000, indicating untapped potential for growth in the market for bike-related products and services.

### Relationship Between Profit and Car Ownership by State:
- New South Wales, Australia, stands out as 50% more profitable than other regions, highlighting significant regional disparities in bike-related profit.
- Car owners in New South Wales significantly contribute to profits compared to non-car owners, suggesting a correlation between car ownership and bike-related spending.
- These findings suggest opportunities for regional market segmentation and targeted strategies to maximize profitability.

### Profit Variation Among Product Lines and Classes: Opportunities for Improvement:
- Products classified under the "Medium Class" in the standard product line generate over six times the profit compared to other product lines and classes, with earnings nearing $6,000,000.
- There is a clear need for marketing improvements in underperforming product lines and classes, which currently generate less than $100,000 in profit.

## Lessons Learned üí°
Throughout this internship, I gained valuable insights:
- Data is the key to informed decision-making.
- Visualization is a powerful tool for communication.
- The world of data analytics is both challenging and rewarding.

## Connect with Me üåü
I'm excited to continue my data-driven journey and connect with others who share a passion for data, analytics, and visualization.
